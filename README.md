## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Anje, a software engineering student based in South Africa.

I love turning creative ideas into stylish, functional web applications that feel intuitive and look amazing. Fonts, colors, and layout are my playgroundâ€”and Iâ€™m all about crafting interfaces that users actually enjoy.

Outside of code and styling, youâ€™ll find me reading novels, exploring new tech tools, or collaborating on group projects that make a real impact. I also enjoy refining documentation and making academic work shine.

### Fun Facts:
- I donâ€™t like coffee or tea.
