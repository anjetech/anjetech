## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anje, a software engineering student with a passion for frontend development and web design.

I love transforming ideas into beautiful, functional applicationsâ€”whether it's crafting sleek interfaces, playing with fonts and styles, or refining user experiences that just *feel right*. My work blends creativity with precision, and I thrive on turning concepts into code.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me curled up with a good book or brainstorming the next big project. I also enjoy collaborating on group assignments, especially when it involves clean documentation and impactful design.

### ðŸŽ¨ What I Enjoy:
- Frontend development with a focus on styling and usability.
- Building dynamic web apps.

### ðŸ¤“ Fun Facts:
- I donâ€™t like coffee or tea (yes, really!)
- Reading is my go-to escape
